# Simulate-Non-Contigious-Memory-Management-Techniques
Simulating non-contiguous memory management techniques like Paging and Segmentation provides a practical understanding of modern memory allocation strategies. Paging divides memory into fixed-size pages and processes into similarly sized frames, facilitating efficient memory use and quick access by mapping logical addresses to physical addresses through page tables. This technique minimizes fragmentation and allows for easier swapping of pages in and out of memory.  
Segmentation, on the other hand, allocates memory in variable-sized segments based on the logical division of a process (code, data, stack). Each segment has a base and a limit, offering a more intuitive approach for programmers by reflecting the program's structure. This method enhances protection and sharing but can suffer from external fragmentation. By simulating these techniques, one can observe the trade-offs in fragmentation, memory utilization, and access speed, providing insights into the complexities of operating system design and the efficiency of different memory management approaches.
